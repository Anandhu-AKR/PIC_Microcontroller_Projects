# PIC Microcontroller Projects üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects using PIC microcontrollers (mainly PIC18 series). Each project demonstrates practical applications such as LED patterns, LCD interfacing, UART communication, and more.

## üìÅ Projects

All projects are organized inside the [`PROJECTS/`](PROJECTS) folder. Example projects include:

- **Blink**: LED pattern generator using push buttons
- **LCD Display**: Displaying strings and sensor data on 16x2 LCD
- **UART Communication**: Sending and receiving data between PIC and PC
- **ADC Reading**: Analog sensor data acquisition and display
- **Motor Control**: Controlling DC motors using L293D
- *(more projects coming soon!)*
