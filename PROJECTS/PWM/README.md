# PIC Microcontroller PWM Generation Project

## üí° Overview
This project demonstrates using a **PIC18F4580 microcontroller** to generate a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal using the CCP1 module and visualize it on an oscilloscope. The duty cycle smoothly ramps from 0 to maximum (0‚Äì255) continuously.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: PIC18F4580
- **LED**: Red LED (optional to visualize brightness)
- **Oscilloscope**: To observe the PWM waveform
- **Resistor**: Current-limiting resistor for LED if used

### Connections
- PWM output ‚Üí RC2 (CCP1 pin)
- LED anode ‚Üí RC2 (via resistor), cathode ‚Üí GND
- Oscilloscope probe connected to RC2 for measurement

## üí° How PWM is Implemented

### CCP1 module
- The CCP1 module is configured in PWM mode (`CCP1CON = 0x0C`).
- Timer2 acts as the time base and controls the PWM period.
- Duty cycle is updated continuously by writing to `CCPR1L`.

### Code behavior
- Starts with a 0% duty cycle (`CCPR1L = 0`).
- Gradually increases to 100% (`CCPR1L = 255`) inside a loop.
- Delay function controls how fast the duty cycle changes.
- Oscilloscope displays changing pulse width as duty cycle ramps.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code

```c
#include <xc.h>

void delay();

void main(void) {
    // Oscillator and PORT setup
    TRISD = 0x00;     // PORTD as output (optional)
    TMR0L = 0;        // Timer0 register
    T0CON = 0xC7;     // Timer0 ON, prescaler 1:256

    // PWM setup
    TRISC = 0x20;     // RC5 as input, RC2 (CCP1) as output
    CCP1CON = 0x0C;   // PWM mode
    TMR2ON = 1;       // Enable Timer2
    TMR2 = 0x00;      // Clear Timer2

    int i;
    while (1) {
        for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
            CCPR1L = i;  // Update duty cycle
            delay();
        }
    }
}

void delay() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 500; j++) {
        }
    }
}

```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to Build & Test
1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile code using MPLAB XC8.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Program the PIC18F4580 with generated HEX file.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Connect LED (if using) and oscilloscope as shown in schematic.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Power up the board.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Observe:
   - LED brightness gradually increases and cycles.
   - Oscilloscope waveform shows pulse width widening from narrow (0% duty) to full (100%).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Interrupts are not used here; PWM is generated entirely in hardware using the CCP1 module.
- The delay function is basic and may be adjusted to change the duty cycle ramp speed.
- You can connect a DC motor or fan to test real-life PWM control (via proper driver circuit).
