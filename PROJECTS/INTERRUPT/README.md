# PIC Microcontroller LED Control Project

## üí° Overview
This project demonstrates using a **PIC18F4580 microcontroller** to control eight red LEDs connected to PORTD. The LEDs toggle in a sequence (`0xCC`, `0x33`, `0x00`) when an **external interrupt** is triggered on INT0 (pin RB0).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: PIC18F4580
- **LEDs**: 8 red LEDs (D1 to D8)
- **Resistor**: 1kŒ© pull-up resistor for interrupt pin

### Connections
- LEDs ‚Üí PORTD pins (RD0 to RD7)
- Interrupt input (INT0) ‚Üí RB0 with 1kŒ© pull-up resistor
- Ground and VCC connections as per schematic

---

## üíª Software Requirements
- **Compiler**: MPLAB XC8 (or compatible)
- **Header**: `<xc.h>` for PIC18F4580 configuration

## üí° How the Interrupt Works

### What is an interrupt?
An interrupt is an event that temporarily halts the main program execution and transfers control to a special function called the **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.

### INT0 usage
- INT0 (RB0) is configured as an external interrupt pin.
- It detects a **falling edge signal** (when RB0 is momentarily connected to ground).
- When triggered, it sets the interrupt flag `INT0IF`, causing the PIC to jump to the ISR.

### ISR implementation
In this project:
- When `INT0IF` becomes `1`, the ISR runs.
- LEDs on PORTD are cycled through a pattern (`0xCC`, `0x33`, `0x00`) with delays.
- After finishing, `INT0IF` is cleared to allow future interrupts.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code

```c
#include <xc.h>

void delay();

void main(void) {
    TRISD = 0x00;  // PORTD as output (LEDs)
    TRISB = 0xFF;  // PORTB as input
    ADCON1 = 0x0F; // Configure all pins as digital
    GIE = 1;       // Enable global interrupts
    PEIE = 1;      // Enable peripheral interrupts
    INT0IE = 1;    // Enable external interrupt INT0

    return;
}

void __interrupt() isr(void) {
    while (INT0IF == 1) {
        LATD = 0xCC;
        delay();
        LATD = 0x33;
        delay();
        LATD = 0x00;
        INT0IF = 0; // Clear interrupt flag
    }
}

void delay() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < 600; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 600; j++) {
        }
    }
}

```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to Use & Test
1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the code using MPLAB XC8.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Program the PIC18F4580 with the generated HEX file.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble the circuit exactly as per the schematic (interrupt.png).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Power on the board.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Momentarily connect RB0 to ground (by pressing a button or touching a wire to GND).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the LEDs cycle through the pattern: 0xCC, 0x33, 0x00.
7Ô∏è‚É£ The LEDs remain off (0x00) until the interrupt is triggered again.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- The delay function is basic and may need tuning depending on the clock frequency.
- No debounce circuit on RB0; spurious triggering may occur. Consider using a hardware debounce (capacitor + resistor) or software debounce.
- LED pattern is fixed in code; modify LATD values to change the pattern.
